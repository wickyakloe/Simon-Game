# Simon - Game

Simon is an electronic game of memory skill.
The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence.

We will try to replicate this game in this project.

## UX

- As a user i can turn the game on and off
- As a user i need to start the game
- As a user i am presented with a random series of button presses.
- As a user each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the 
same series of button presses but with an additional step.
- As a user I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series 
of button presses plays, and when I personally press a button.
- As a user if I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and
that series of button presses starts again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again.
- As a user i can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses.
- As a user if I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.
- As a user i can play in strict mode where if I get a button press wrong, it notifies
  me that I have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.
- As a  user i can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. I am notified of my victory, then the game starts over.
Hint: Here are mp3s you can use for each button: https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/simonSound1.mp3, https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/simonSound2.mp3, https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/simonSound3.mp3, https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/simonSound4.mp3.

<!--### Existing Features-->
<!--- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z-->
<!--- ...-->

<!--For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.-->

<!--In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:-->

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

Tested using [Jasmin]
<!--In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.-->

<!--Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.-->

<!--For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:-->

<!--1. Contact form:-->
<!--    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page-->
<!--    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears-->
<!--    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears-->
<!--    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.-->

<!--In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.-->

<!--You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.-->

<!--If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.-->
